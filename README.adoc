= diiLo: Dual panel inventory manager
:icons: font

This project implements an inventory manager in the dual panel flavor known from old and loved file managers. It requires nothing more than a text console and stores data in plain text files.

It allows an efficient tracking of stock movement between locations, sources and projects.

CAUTION: *This project is not production ready, use at your own risk and backup regularly*

== Goals

* The intended use case for this tool is a small electronic lab, a RC modeller's workshop or similar.
* Few hundreds to thousands of items in dozen locations or boxes.
* A workflow where the tool just helps with finding the right piece for the current project at hand and the inventory tracking accuracy is secondary to the ease of use.
* Updating the digital database happens in bulk, usually at the end of a session based on paper notes. Part counts can get a bit out of sync, but should be easy to fix.

For these reasons I defined the cornerstones of the project that should be used when in doubt about a feature or implementation:

* Easy and quick way to enter data, movements and deliveries.
* No hard constraints preventing actions - the tool should adapt to the reality, not the other way around.
* Easy way to fix counts or placements based on real world situation.
* Keyboard friendly navigation. Can be used over ssh or other terminal solution.
* Human readable and editable data storage format:
** both the raw storage itself,
** and the semantics, minimize typing and complex string and id related relationships.
** Data should be trivial to backup and restore.
** Data should be trivial to synchronize across machines using some off-the-shelf solution (Syncthing, Dropbox, Nextcloud) and conflicts should be reasonably easy to fix.

== Why diiLo

* DÃ­lo in Czech means work, accomplishment.
* It is an ASCII art - a warehouse forklift.
* It is easy to type on a qwerty keyboard, most of the letters are clustered together.
* It started as a play on words dual, inventory, II (roman numeral 2), interface, ledger.

== Data storage

The data is stored according to the https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/[FreeDesktop's XDG Base Directory specification].

Data go to `$HOME/.local/share/diilo/` directory. Internally there are two sub-directories - `md` for definition files and `ledger` for tracking movements and deliveries.

== Building

This project is developed using the https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] language. The UI is done using the https://ratatui.rs/[ratatui crate].

All you need to do is install the https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[rust toolchain] (https://rustup.rs/[rustup] is recommended) and cargo.

Then simply type:

```
$ cargo run
```

== Debugging issues

The program writes a detailed log to a cache directory that is by default located in `$HOME/.cache/diilo/diilo.log`

The verbosity is set to `INFO` by default and can be controlled by environment variables. See https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging for details of how to control the levels and filters.

When a crash occurs, it is useful to reproduce it with the Rust's `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable set. This provides detailed information about where the issue happened.

In case a crash corrupts the terminal behavior (no characters printed, weird colors, etc.), type `reset` to the terminal and press `<Enter>`.
